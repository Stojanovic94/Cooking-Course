# Project Name: Cooking Course

## What it is.

A curated web form designed to allows users to input their details for the cooking course.

##  How it works. 

### 1. **Web Form Creation**
   - A user-friendly form was developed to collect various details, including name(s), contact information, and preferred cooking styles or course schedules by the user.
   - Each field was clearly labeled to ensure users understand the type of information required.

### 2. **Validation**
   - Client-side validation was implemented using JavaScript to ensure all fields are properly completed and verified before submission.
   - Error messages were displayed if any mandatory fields were left empty or if the data entered did not meet the required format (e.g., invalid phone number or email address).
   
### 3. **Form Submission**
   - Upon successful completion and validation of the form, the data is processed and displayed as a confirmation message on the page.
   - The form is structured to be easily extensible if additional fields or functionality are required in the future.

### 4. **User Interface and Styling**
   - The form is designed to be simple, clean, and functional. Basic styling was applied to improve usability, ensuring a smooth experience for users.
   - Responsive design was considered to ensure the form displays well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Reflection

This exercise helped solidify my understanding of forms, validation, and client-side interactivity. The experience gained in completing this task will be valuable for future projects involving user input and data processing.
